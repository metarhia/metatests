`metatests` is an extremely simple to use test framework and runner for Metarhia
technology stack built on the following principles:

- Test cases are files, tests are either imperative (functions) or declarative
  (arrays and structures).

- Assertions are done using the built-in Node.js `assert` module. The framework
  also provides additional testing facilities (like spies).

- Tests can be run in parallel.

- All tests are executed in isolated sandboxes. The framework allows to easily
  mock modules required by tests and provides ready-to-use mocks for timers and
  other core functionality.

- Testing asynchronous operations must be supported.

- Testing pure functions without asynchronous operations and state can be done
  without extra boilerplate code using DSL based on arrays.

  ```javascript
  mt.case(
    'Test common.duration',
    { common },
    {
      // ...
      'common.duration': [
        ['1d', 86400000],
        ['10h', 36000000],
        ['7m', 420000],
        ['13s', 13000],
        ['2d 43s', 172843000],
        // ...
      ],
      // ...
    },
  );
  ```

- The framework must work in Node.js and browsers (using Webpack or any other
  module bundler that supports CommonJS modules and emulates Node.js globals).
